Callbacks generally define logic for one-off responses. If you perform a database query, for example, you can specify a callback to determine what to do with the query results. The callback may display the database results, do a calculation based on the results, or execute another callback using the query results as an argument. Event listeners, on the other hand, are essentially callbacks that are associated with a conceptual entity (an event). For comparison, a mouse click is an event you would handle in the browser when someone clicks the mouse. As an example, in Node an HTTP server emits a request event when an HTTP request is made. You can listen for that request event to occur and add some response logic.
